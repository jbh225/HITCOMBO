USA's Liquid|NuckleDu is First Street Fighter 5 World Champion!\r\nAnaheim, CA, USA | Playstation Experience | December 02 - December 03 | Results\r\nCapcom Cup 2016 Results\r\nThe 2016 Capcom Pro Tour season has been an amazing one, with thousands of players around the world competing. It was also the first year to feature Street Fighter 5, which made it all the more exciting as we watched players adapt to the game's evolving meta. In the end only 32 players earned a qualifying spot to Capcom Cup 2016 to compete, with the winner taking home over $120,000 in prize money and the title of Street Fighter 5 World Champion.\r\nIn addition to the monetary prize and the World Champion title, the winner would also be able to take home the actual Capcom Cup (shown above), which will have their name engraved on it for posterity, for the year. Next season the winner will have to defend the right to keep the cup, or will have to turn it over to Capcom Cup 2017's winner!\r\n\r\nIf You Couldn't Watch Live, You Need to See These Matches!\r\nThere were so many incredible matches at Capcom Cup 2016. If you could not watch the event, or if you missed some matches here and there, be sure to visit the capcom page [here](http://capcomprotour.com/videos/) to watch the previous video of the qualifications, where we will have a playlist for matches from Capcom Cup 2016. You can also go to the [Capcom Fighters Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/CapcomFightersTV) to see match videos and replays there.\r\n\r\n[Here is the final match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faHt0G913y8&t=3s)\r\n***\r\n##GRAN TURISMO SPORTS\r\n![gran turismo sports](http://www.teamshmo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GT-sport.jpg)\r\nDecember 9th 2016\r\n\r\nGRAN TURISMO SPORTS FANS JUST STILL HAVE TO WAIT\r\n\r\nAs is often said, everything comes in time to the one who knows how to wait ...\r\nGran Turismo fans are often heard during this year 2016.\r\nIndeed, the game that was originally scheduled for November 12, 2016 will only be available at the beginning of 2017.\r\n\r\nThis new delay is due in particular to the mixed return of the fans who were able to test the beta version of the game which was not worthy of what one could expect of a first Gran Turismo game on Playstation 4.\r\nThe developers of the game have returned to work in order to fine-tune the final settings as best as possible so that it receives the best possible reception of the public.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be seen whether the corrections made to the game will suffice to compete with the competition that are: Project cars, Forza Horizon or WRC 6\r\n\r\n[Here is the gameplay trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNiQC83icV8)\r\n***\r\n#ABOUT ME\r\nPassionate about new technologies and video games.
