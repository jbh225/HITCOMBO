Capcom Cup 2016 Results
The 2016 Capcom Pro Tour season has been an amazing one, with thousands of players around the world competing. It was also the first year to feature Street Fighter 5, which made it all the more exciting as we watched players adapt to the game's evolving meta. In the end only 32 players earned a qualifying spot to Capcom Cup 2016 to compete, with the winner taking home over $120,000 in prize money and the title of Street Fighter 5 World Champion.
In addition to the monetary prize and the World Champion title, the winner would also be able to take home the actual Capcom Cup (shown above), which will have their name engraved on it for posterity, for the year. Next season the winner will have to defend the right to keep the cup, or will have to turn it over to Capcom Cup 2017's winner!</p>

<p>GRAN TURISMO SPORTS FANS JUST STILL HAVE TO WAIT</p>

<p>As is often said, everything comes in time to the one who knows how to wait ...
Gran Turismo fans are often heard during this year 2016.
Indeed, the game that was originally scheduled for November 12, 2016 will only be available at the beginning of 2017.</p>

<p>This new delay is due in particular to the mixed return of the fans who were able to test the beta version of the game which was not worthy of what one could expect of a first Gran Turismo game on Playstation 4.
The developers of the game have returned to work in order to fine-tune the final settings as best as possible so that it receives the best possible reception of the public.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether the corrections made to the game will suffice to compete with the competition that are: Project cars, Forza Horizon or WRC 6</p>
